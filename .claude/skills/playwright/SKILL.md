## Snapshots

After each command, playwright-cli provides a snapshot of the current browser state.

```bash
> npx playwright-cli goto https://example.com
### Page
- Page URL: https://example.com/
- Page Title: Example Domain
### Snapshot
[Snapshot](.playwright-cli/page-2026-02-14T19-22-42-679Z.yml)
```

You can also take a snapshot on demand using `npx playwright-cli snapshot` command.

If `--filename` is not provided, a new snapshot file is created with a timestamp. Default to automatic file naming, use `--filename=` when artifact is a part of the workflow result.

## Browser Sessions

```bash
# create new browser session named "mysession" with persistent profile
npx playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --persistent
# same with manually specified profile directory (use when requested explicitly)
npx playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --profile=/path/to/profile
npx playwright-cli -s=mysession click e6
npx playwright-cli -s=mysession close  # stop a named browser
npx playwright-cli -s=mysession delete-data  # delete user data for persistent session

npx playwright-cli list
# Close all browsers
npx playwright-cli close-all
# Forcefully kill all browser processes
npx playwright-cli kill-all
```

npx playwright-cli open https://example.com/form
npx playwright-cli snapshot

npx playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
npx playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
npx playwright-cli click e3
